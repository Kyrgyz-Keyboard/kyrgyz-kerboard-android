<h1 align="center">Kyrgyz Keyboard with AI-Powered Features</h1>

## Idea

Develop a user-friendly Kyrgyz keyboard application with AI-powered features such as predictive text (T9), a grammar checker, and a paraphrasing tool to promote the Kyrgyz language in digital communication.

## Problem

Current Kyrgyz system keyboards are copies of the Russian layout, lacking dedicated Kyrgyz letters. Users must long-press keys to access Kyrgyz-specific characters (e.g., `ң`, `ө`, `ү`), making correct spelling inconvenient.

Additionally, the absence of T9/autocorrect leads to typos and informal shortcuts (e.g., `курут` → `курки`) or, in some cases, fails to provide suggestions. As a result, users default to Russian for convenience, further eroding Kyrgyz language usage in digital spaces.

## Product Features

- **Comfortable Layout**: Optimized Kyrgyz keyboard layout with all letters accessible via single taps
- **Predictive Text (T9)**: AI-driven word suggestions and autocorrect
- **Grammar Checker**: Real-time spelling and grammar corrections
- **Paraphrasing Tool**: Rewrite sentences using [AkylAI](https://www.akylai.com) (the Kyrgyz AI assistant) or a custom NLP model
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Customizable themes, emojis, and stickers for improved interaction

## Learning Value

- **Mobile Development**: Kotlin (Android) / Swift (iOS) for keyboard integration
- **AI/ML**: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for NLP models (predictive text, grammar correction)
- **NLP Tools**: Libraries like spaCy for Kyrgyz language processing
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS/Google Cloud for AI model hosting

## Potential Challenges

#### Existing Kyrgyz Keyboards
- The only available options are system keyboards with basic layouts and no AI-powered features
- The [Facemoji app](https://www.facemojikeyboard.com) offers customization but supports only English, with no Kyrgyz layout

#### Linguistic Challenges
- **Agglutinative structure**: Kyrgyz word formation complicates NLP model development
- **Limited datasets**: There is a lack of online linguistic resources in Kyrgyz
- **Dialect variations**: Differences between Northern and Southern Kyrgyz may affect language modeling
