Idea

Develop a user-friendly Kyrgyz keyboard application with AI-powered additional features like: predictive text (T9), grammar checker, paraphrasing in order to promote the Kyrgyz language in digital communication.

Problem

Current Kyrgyz system keyboards are the copy of Russian one with no specific letters and requiring users to long-press keys for Kyrgyz letters (e.g., ң, ө, ү). This discourages proper Kyrgyz spelling.
In addition, the lack of T9/autocorrect leads to typos and informal shortcuts (e.g., "курут" → "курки") or simply, don’t show anything. That’s why, users default to Russian for convenience, eroding Kyrgyz language use in tech.

Product Results

Comfortable Layout: Optimized Kyrgyz keyboard layout with all letters accessible via one single taps.
Predictive Text (T9): AI-driven word suggestions and autocorrect.
Grammar Hints: Real-time grammar/spelling corrections.
Paraphrasing Tool: Rewrite sentences using AkylAI (the kyrgyz AI assistant) or a custom NLP model.
User Experience: Customizable themes, emojis, and stickers for better interaction between the users.

Learning Value

Mobile Development: Kotlin (Android) / Swift (iOS) for keyboard integration.
AI/ML: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for NLP models (predictive text, grammar checks).
NLP Tools: Libraries like spaCy for Kyrgyz language processing.
Cloud: AWS/Google Cloud for AI model deployment.
Potential Problems
Are there any Kyrgyz keyboards already?
Only by the phone system ones and they are likely limited to basic layouts without any hints. As a customizable keyboard - “Facemoji” app but with only English layout.

Linguistic Challenges:
Kyrgyz is an agglutinative language, complicating NLP models.
Lack of online information in Kyrgyz for datasets
Dialect variations (Northern vs. Southern Kyrgyz).
